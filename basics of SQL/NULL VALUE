--What is a NULL Value -------->>>>>>>>>>>> 
--A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains 
--spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

--How to Test for NULL Values? -------->>>>>>>>>>>> It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such
--as =, <, or <>. We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

--IS NULL Syntax  -------->>>>>>>>>>>>SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM DeviceMaster_V1 WHERE AssignVehDate IS NULL;

--IS NOT NULL Syntax  -------->>>>>>>>>>>> SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
SELECT * FROM DeviceMaster_V1 WHERE AssignVehDate IS NOT NULL;
